## Essential rules

### Commit

- Commit for each task individually. If necessary, commit during the task as well.
  - Add the suffix [commit by roo code] to all commit messages.
- Write the commit message in English.
- Follow the commit message format.
  - `git commit -m "{a simple task wrap}: {about the change you made} [commit by roo code]"`

### Cooperation with me

- If you fail the test more than twice in a row, organize the current situation and think about the solution together. Avoid trial and error without a hypothesis.
  - You have extensive knowledge learned from GitHub, and you can implement individual algorithms and libraries faster than I can. Write the code while explaining it to me, and verify it with test code.
- On the other hand, you are not good at processing according to the current context. Please confirm those with me.
