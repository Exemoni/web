## Essential rules

### Commit

- Commit for each task individually. If necessary, commit during the task as well.
- Write the commit message in English.
- Commit frequently and avoid committing more than two files at once unless there is a clear reason.
- Do not commit multiple tasks at once.
- Add an appropriate prefix Emoji to all commit messages.
- Add the suffix [commit by roo code] to all commit messages.
  - See here for the list of Emoji prefixes. [Emoji Prefix List](#emoji-prefix-list)
- Follow the leading format.
  - `git commit -m "{Emoji prefix} {A simple task wrap}: {Change you made} [commit by roo code]"`

### Cooperation with me

- If you fail the test more than twice in a row, organize the current situation and think about the solution together. Avoid trial and error without a hypothesis.
- You have extensive knowledge learned from GitHub, and you can implement individual algorithms and libraries faster than I can. Write the code while explaining it to me, and verify it with test code.
- On the other hand, you are not good at processing according to the current context. Please confirm those with me.
