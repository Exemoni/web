### Cooperation with me

- If you fail the test more than twice in a row, organize the current situation and think about the solution together. Avoid trial and error without a hypothesis.
- You have extensive knowledge learned from GitHub, and you can implement individual algorithms and libraries faster than I can. Write the code while explaining it to me, and verify it with test code.
- On the other hand, you are not good at processing according to the current context. Please confirm those with me.
